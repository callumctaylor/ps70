    <h1>Week 6: Casting Dry Electrodes</h1>

    <p>This week’s assignment was to use a CNC process, to create a design and post-process it through molding, casting, vacuum forming, or composites. After discussing with Nathan and the TFS, I slightly pivoted from direct CNC machining. Instead, I focused on building molds and casting to solve a real-world challenge for our livestock EMS system, building a reusable “dry” electrode that works without conductive gel.</p>

    <h2>Problem: Gel Electrodes Won’t Work on our Cows</h2>
    <p>Most EMS systems use gel-based disposable electrodes. But these are impractical in the field. The gel dries out quickly, creating painful “hotspot” sensations and inconsistent contact, especially problematic when trying to stimulate through a thick coat of animal hair.</p>
    <p>To address this, I needed to develop a reusable electrode that:</p>
    <ul class="text-start">
      <li>Doesn’t dry out</li>
      <li>Can pass current through fur</li>
      <li>Feels safe and smooth on the skin</li>
      <li>Is robust and field-usable</li>
    </ul>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <div id="stlViewer"></div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Designing the Mold</h2>
    <p>Instead of using CNC milling, I used a resin 3D printer to create fine-detail molds. My electrode design includes 1mm contact pins, which are simply too small and delicate for CNC tooling. SLA printing gave me the precision I needed to mold around those features.</p>
    <p>I created a series of iterations:</p>
    <ul class="text-start">
      <li>The first mold held a flat electrode puck</li>
      <li>Later versions introduced pin-like protrusions to help penetrate fur</li>
      <li>I added cavities for holding different materials inside the mold</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exploring Dry Conductive Materials</h2>
    <p>The second part of the challenge was finding a material that could conduct electricity without needing water-based gels. Here’s what I tested:</p>
    <ol class="text-start">
      <li><strong>Glycerol</strong> – Hygroscopic and skin-safe, but not naturally conductive enough</li>
      <li><strong>Glycerol + Choline Chloride</strong> – A eutectic solvent (Google taught me that word) that increases ion availability, making the contact better with skin</li>
      <li><strong>Polyurethane + Graphene Powder</strong> – The idea was to make a flexible, moldable conductive elastomer. However, graphene disrupted the polyurethane cure and remained too resistive</li>
      <li><strong>Graphene Conductive Paint</strong> – This worked surprisingly well for surface coating, but wasn’t viable through fur since it couldn’t hold enough hygroscopic material</li>
      <li><strong>Agarose + Glycerol & Choline Chloride</strong> – Agarose helped hold the solution together, and I could pour it into the mold and let it set. The result was a flexible, semi-gelled puck that could conform to skin and hold enough glycerol</li>
    </ol>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <div id="stlViewer"></div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Final Test: It Worked (Mostly)</h2>
    <p>I brought the electrode to a test on a farm and applied it to the cow. I wasn’t able to get the graphene-coated electrode to trigger a strong response through the coat—it wasn’t conductive enough. But the agarose/glycerol blend worked. It made enough contact to trigger visible muscle contraction without discomfort.</p>

    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <ul class="text-start">
      <li>Resin printing is a powerful alternative to CNC for small, high-precision molds</li>
      <li>Conductivity in flexible materials is harder than expected, there’s a tradeoff between mechanical properties and electrical performance</li>
      <li>Agarose is a surprisingly good material for flexible electrodes, it holds shape and retains moisture, without being sticky</li>
      <li>Iteration is key: I went through at least 4 failed attempts before finding a combo that worked</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <ul class="text-start">
      <li>Refine the electrode mold design for better surface conformity</li>
      <li>Maybe explore conductive silicones like EcoFlex + carbon black or silver powder</li>
      <li>Design a snap-in connector to easily swap electrodes in and out of the collar</li>
    </ul>
