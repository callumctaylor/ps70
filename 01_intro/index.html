<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Muscle Stimulation Collar for Virtual Fencing</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

<p class = "margin">
  Instead of traditional electric shock collars, I would build a collar that uses muscle stimulation to create tactile sensations on livestock. This would be used in virtual fencing systems to keep livestock within a designated area without causing pain or discomfort.
</br></br>
  We would use an nRF91 chip for cellular communication, which allows the collar to send and receive data over long distances. The collar would be equipped with various sensors to detect the movement and behavior of the livestock, ensuring they stay within the designated area. A solar panel would be integrated to provide a renewable source of energy, while a LiPo battery would store this energy to power the device continuously. Additionally, GPS would be used for precise positioning, enabling accurate tracking of the livestock's location at all times.
</p>


<h4>Idea 2: IoT Water Sensor for Ranching</h4>

<p class = "margin">
This project involves creating an IoT water sensor system to optimize water management on ranches. The sensor would monitor water levels in tanks and troughs in real-time and send data to a central system. This would save farmers time from having to travel out to check water levels manually. Additionally, the system would detect leaks and monitor water consumption across the farm, ensuring efficient water usage and preventing wastage.
</br></br>
The system would use an nRF91 chip for long-range cellular communication, allowing sensors to transmit data over large distances. Solar panels would power the sensors, making them energy-efficient and sustainable. The central system would analyze the data and provide farmers with insights and alerts via a mobile app, helping them make informed decisions about water management.
</p>

<h4>Idea 3: Biometric Ear Tag for Cattle </h4>

<p class = "margin">
This project involves developing a biometric ear tag for cattle that measures various biometric data using IMU sensors and an nRF91 chip for communication. The ear tag would be designed to monitor the health and behavior of the cattle in real-time, providing valuable insights to farmers.
</br></br>
The IMU sensors would track movement, orientation, and activity levels of the cattle, helping to detect any unusual behavior that might indicate health issues. The nRF91 chip would enable long-range cellular communication, allowing the ear tag to send data to a central system where it can be analyzed.
</br></br>
The ear tag would be powered by a small solar panel, ensuring it remains operational without the need for frequent battery replacements. The collected data would be transmitted to a cloud-based platform, where it could be accessed by farmers through a mobile app. This would allow farmers to monitor the health and well-being of their cattle remotely, receive alerts about potential health issues, and make informed decisions about their livestock management.
