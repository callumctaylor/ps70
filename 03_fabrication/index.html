    <h1>Week 7: Kinetic Sculpture – "Cat on the Turntable"</h1>

    <p>For this week’s kinetic sculpture assignment, I was inspired by cat sculptures like Jonsey the Cat and this
      playful cat design since my girlfriend loves cats. I wanted to build a sculpture where a cat bops to the rhythm of
      a spinning turntable - with the whole mechanism driven by a single motor and couple gears.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>My goal was to CNC and fabricate all the main structural components, then integrate a motorized gear system to
      animate both:</p>
    <ul class="text-start">
      <li>The record player with the dancing mouse</li>
      <li>The cat's arms, moving in a rhythmic "bop"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Phase 1: Cardboard Prototype</h2>
    <p>I started by sketching the geometry in Fusion 360 and exporting a DXF for cutting. My first prototype was built
      using cardboard - just to understand basic scale and component layout. It wasn’t functional (at all), but it
      helped me figure out how the elements would be layered and how the dowels and cams might interact.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4"> <img src="cow_cardboard1.JPG" alt="Electrode Stripped">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4"> <img src="cow_cardboard2.JPG" alt="Graphene Bench">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4"> <img src="cow_cardboard3.JPG" alt="Electrode Stripped">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Phase 2: First Wooden Version</h2>
    <p>From there, I moved to a sturdier version with CNC cut wood. This gave me much better structure, but I ran into
      several mechanical issues:</p>
    <ul class="text-start">
      <li>The gear ratios I had estimated weren’t working well</li>
      <li>The motor shaft was interfering with the dowel that animated the cat</li>
      <li>The arms couldn’t lift smoothly and often got stuck</li>
      <li>My layout didn’t allow for enough clearance between moving parts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite the improved materials, the movement wasn’t translating well, and I couldn't mount the yellow hobby motor
      without it colliding with other parts.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12"> <img src="wooden_cuts.JPG" alt="Electrode Stripped">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Phase 3: Full Redesign in Fusion 360</h2>
    <p>Realizing I needed to rethink the mechanics, I returned to Fusion and fully re-modeled the sculpture as a box
      assembly, ensuring all gears, arms, cams, and dowels had precise placement and clearances.</p>
    <p>Changes included:</p>
    <ul class="text-start">
      <li>Enlarging the box to give better space for movement</li>
      <li>Separating the record-player and cat-arm mechanisms</li>
      <li>Switching to a 3D-printed bevel gear instead of wood, to better redirect motion with tighter tolerances</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12"> <img src="modelled_version.jpg" alt="Electrode Stripped">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, the 3D printer started stringing badly, and I wasn’t able to finish printing the bevel gear in
      time. As a result, I didn’t get to fully assemble the final working version with the motor.</p>
    <p>That said:</p>
    <ul class="text-start">
      <li>All the parts are modeled and ready</li>
      <li>The mechanical interactions have been redesigned</li>
      <li>The sculpture box is structurally complete</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the working gear prints, the system should work exactly as intended.</p>

    <h2>What I learnt</h2>
    <ul class="text-start">
      <li>Testing in cardboard is a quick way to validate layout before cutting expensive material</li>
      <li>Motors tolerance and gears were not very forgiving</li>
      <li>3D printing gears is useful when cnc cutting methods can’t provide the geometry</li>
      <li>Kinetic sculptures require clearance and spacing, things that look fine in 2D often collide in 3D</li>
    </ul>
