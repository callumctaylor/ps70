    <h1>Week 7: MVP Assignment</h1>

    <p>For my MVP I wanted to test the core of my product which is the muscle stimulation technology and how it
      interacts with the animal. For this MVP, there were a large number of elements of the product I had to develop.
      These elements are the casing of the device, conductive electrodes, the collar, the muscle stimulation circuit,
      and the PCB to connect the microcontroller (MCU) and other circuits.</p>

    <h2>Conductive Electrodes</h2>
    <p>One of the core elements of the muscle stimulation device is having electrodes that maintain good contact on the
      skin and penetrates the hair of the cow. This was a difficult problem since there were no off the shelf solutions.
    </p>

    <p>I started by testing FDM prints, however, due to the small pin size it was too difficult to create a reliable
      print. The pins kept snapping and there was a lot of stringing between the pins that affected the electrodes
      pushing through. I then tested an SLA resin print to be able to create the 1mm pins and it worked out great. There
      was still some element of pin breaking, but it was minimal for the testing I needed to do. I also tried an SLS
      style print to improve the flexibility and robustness of the product. These looked great, however, created some
      issues when it came to spraying mentioned later.</p>

    <p>To make the prints conductive, I got MG Chemicals Nickel and Carbon spray paints. After post-processing the 3D
      prints, I sprayed the SLA resin and SLS prints with nickel and then carbon, leaving it 24 hours to cure. The SLA
      resin prints worked great, with only a couple ohms resistance across the whole part, with a very reliable coating.
      The SLS print did not perform well. Because of the grainy texture, the conductive paint did not make a good coat,
      and the resistance was much higher (3k ohm to no conductive path for some pins). I decided to stick with an SLA
      print until I come up with a urethane cast alternative.</p>

    <h2>The Collar</h2>

    <h2>Muscle Stimulation Circuit</h2>
    <p>I designed a muscle stimulation circuit (attached) using a H-bridge circuit to create the biphasic wave, and a
      Texas Instruments (TI) boost convertor to control the high output voltage. This method worked very well. I first
      tied using a current mirror approach so I could control the current going through the muscle but had a lot of
      issues with this approach since it is highly inefficient. Instead, I’ll add a current feedback circuit so the MCU
      can measure the current going through the muscle and adjust the output voltage (discrete implementation instead of
      analogue).</p>

    <h2>PCBs</h2>
    <p>I had to create four different PCBs for the MVP. The first is a carrier board that held our nRF9160 Feather Board
      that has comms and power management. It also connected the GPIOs to the other PCBs. The second PCB had a 12V boost
      convertor and the third had a high voltage boost convertor for the muscle stimulation circuitry. The fourth board
      is the H-Bridge controller for generating the biphasic waves.</p>

    <p>I designed these PCB in Fusion 360 and had them manufactured with JLC PCB. I did the assembly myself using solder
      paste for the surface mount components. The PCBs came together really well but are pretty bulky. I am current
      working on two PCBs that hold all the components on them and connect over a flexible PCB connector. This will
      significantly reduce the size of our case and give us options for what components we use.</p>

    <h2>Casing of Device</h2>
    <p>To house the device, I had to build a separate case that held the circuitry and connected it with the collar. I
      also had to build plates the connected the electrodes to the collar and adjusted in the placement. I designed the
      cases taking measurements of the PCB, cables and battery using a digital caliper, added some LEDs, and created the
      slot that let us connect to the collar. It took a few goes to get the prints to house everything. They are still
      pretty bulky but will be improved in a future version.</p>

      <div class="col-md-3"> <img src="3dprint1.JPG" alt=""></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Coding it All</h2>
    <p>To be able to control the device over internet, I used the zephyr coding environment and AWS libraries to connect
      to AWS IoT Core. I then used buttons on a simple react website to send commands to IoT Core which communicated
      with the device over MQTT. This worked pretty well and the latency went down to under 1 second. This was good
      enough for the first trial.</p>

    <h2>Testing the Device</h2>
    <p>The biggest part of the MVP – does it actually work? I found a farm that is only 40 minutes away who was happy
      for me to come out with a friend and test the device on some dairy cows. Everything was tested online. We went to
      the farm, and I put electrode gel on the cow to help with contact and removing ‘hot spots’ until I figure out a
      more durable solution (working on materials now).</p>

    <p>The trial worked almost perfectly! I put together a video of the trial below. The farmer mentioned, the muscle
      stimulation worked better than her moving the cows. Although some of the sensations look pretty strong, all these
      values we tested on ourselves and it feels ‘tactile’ rather than painful. Our low voltage system doesn’t engage
      pain receptors but rather uses the muscles to control the cows. She was a very gentle cow and gave her a cuddle
      after the trials :). </p>

    <h2>Input/Output device</h2>
    <p>Our device has many input and output devices. We have an IMU, digital magnometer, and adding current feedback
      circuits. We also control LEDs to show device status, whilst having the muscle stimulator as our main output
      device.</p>

    <h2>Measuring Device Clocks</h2>
    <p>Our device runs at 16MHz set period. I changed the periods on the device for the PWM elements that run at
      customizable periods. I scoped these outputs at saw it running correctly. I then scoped the muscle stimulator
      output before testing on myself and saw the outputs below.</p>
