        <h2>Creating My Box</h2>
        <p>The process of desiging and building this custom box was frustrating but also was a great process in learning to laser cut. Using Fusion 360, I began by sketching the box's dimensions (with references with teh online tutorial), ensuring to define parameters for length, width, height, and material thickness of the carboard. The use of parameters allowed for easy adjustments later if I made a mistake with the design.</p>
        <p>To make sure the joints were strong, we used finger joints in the design. THe interlocking tabs were fairly easy to design and for laser-cutting the carboard (for both strength and alignment).</p>
        <p>Before cutting the final version, I made a few smaller test boxes. These prototypes were super helpful for spotting any issues and tweaking the design. I also now have some handy little boxes for screws and other small stuff.</p>
        <p>For the final design, I added handles to make the box easier to carry. I switched to Rhino to design ergonomic handle cutouts to carry the box around the lab, was also inspired by other designs classmates had. Getting these handles aligned with the box sides was tricky, but after some adjustments and careful measuring, I got it to work pretty well.</p>
        <p>Once the design was done, I exported the sketches and used the lab's laser cutters. This whole process showed me how important prototyping is and how useful it can be to use software tools to model it before constructing the board.</p>

        <h2>Fusion 360 Models Tutorials</h2>
        <p>Even though I know Fusion 360 pretty well, I wanted to get better at some specific things. So, I checked out a few tutorials on form creation and rendering techniques (links below).</p>
        <p>The "Introduction to Forms in Fusion 360" tutorial was great for learning how to make complex shapes with the Form tool. It's a cool way to create more organic and freeform designs, which is different from the usual parametric modeling I was used to.</p>
        <p>Another tutorial, "How to Get Realistic Renderings in Fusion 360," taught me how to apply materials, set up lighting, and tweak environment settings to get photorealistic images of my models. This is super handy for making my designs look polished and professional.</p>
        <p>These tutorials really helped me understand more about what Fusion 360 can do and gave me the skills to make my designs look even better.</p>
        <p>Here are some tutorials that I found really helpful:</p>

        <h2>Modeling a Hair Comb</h2>
        <p>Using what I learned from the tutorials, I decided to model a hair comb that was on my desk. My goal was to create a design that was both functional and comfortable to use.</p>
        <p>I started by sketching the comb's profile, using smooth, spline lines to make it fit well in hand. I used a pattern feature to create the teeth of the comb, ensuring they were evenly spaced and sized.</p>
        <p>To improve the design, I used the Form tool to adjust the handle's curvature, making it more ergonomic. This allowed for small tweaks that made the comb more comfortable to hold.</p>
        <p>After finishing the model, I applied materials and rendered the comb to see how it would look. The rendering techniques I learned earlier helped me showcase the design's features and aesthetics effectively.</p>

        <h2>Creating a Case for My Final Project (Livestock Virtual Fencing Collar)</h2>
        <p>For my final project, I needed to design a case for a livestock virtual fencing collar to house the electronic components.</p>
        <p>I started by measuring the test PCBs I had made earlier to ensure the case would fit them perfectly. Although I lost the physical solar panels, I found their dimensions online and modeled them in Fusion 360 to make sure they would fit in the case.</p>
        <p>The challenge was to create a case that could flex around a cow's neck. To do this, I decided to use TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) material because it's flexible and durable. The case design included a flexible middle section to make it comfortable for the animal.</p>
        <p>I made both a flexed version and a flat version of the case in Fusion 360. The flexed version involved using splines and the Form tool to simulate the bending of the material, which was tricky because I had to keep the thickness uniform and avoid distortion. This required several adjustments and problem-solving in Fusion 360.</p>
        <p>After finalizing the design, I applied materials and rendered the case to see how it would look. The rendering helped me visualize the final product and evaluate the design.</p>
