    <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
    <p>To assist with my final project, I first worked on the electrode contact methods to get through the animal’s coat
      and connect with the skin. I designed these in Fusion 360, using small 1mm pins to minimize the surface area
      required to get through the coat. Rather than having to do a whole bunch of individual pins, I used the pattern
      functionality to duplicate the pins across the board. It is extremely difficult to solder anything to a 3D print
      since it will just melt, so instead I created a small pin in the side where the plug can snugly into the
      electrode. I did some FDM tests of different pin styles, concluding that 1mm pins worked best in penetrating hair.
    </p>

    <p>The second model I worked on was for a project to create a 1:1 cow head and neck that would allow me to test the
      collar fit on the animal. Since the geometry mapping of a cow is difficult and I don’t have a lot of access to
      one, I found online a free model that is a good starting point. This model was the entire body of the animal, so I
      used Prusa slicer to split the cow from the neck up and I printed a smaller scaler version on the print bed to
      check the quality. </p>

    <h2>3D Printing</h2>
    <p>Not content with the results from FDM printing the 1mm electrodes, which often broken easily and had a lot of
      stringing), I decided to try SLA printing to get high resolution quality. Kassia was a huge help in learning how
      to use the SLA print. It was a lot more work than an FDM in the post processing, however, the resolution was
      fantastic and far superior to FMD printing. With Kassia’s help, I attempted both rigid and flexible resin
      prints.
      I’ll have to test them on a cow, but I believe the flexible SLA prints are too soft and won’t push through the
      coat of the animal. I coated these SLA prints with a nickel spray-paint, so that they will be conductive.
      Testing
      them with a slight amount of electrode gel, it works extremely well.</p>
    <p>The print for the cow worked extremely well and the cow looks fantastic. The next steps I will do will be to
      cut
      this up many more times, look at using dovetail connectors to connect the head together, and then print these
      individual sections on FDM printers. I will explore JLC PCB for these components, but the shipping cost will
      probably not be worth it (a quick quote looks like it’s $450 to ship).</p>

    <h2>3D Scanning</h2>
    <p>I tried scanning a bunch of different objects, including my PCBs, but had a lot of issues with the black
      components not being picked up. I decided to try the tube of hydrogel I have with me since it has interesting
      contours. It was pretty difficult without the stand to reduce the noise, but two fairly good scans. I had to
      do a
      lot of post processing editing and because of the uniformity of the cap I had issues lining up the two scans
      together. It created a pretty wonky output and the bottom half of the STL didn’t have much to it. In future, I
      would love to try 3D scan a cow if possible!</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>Next, I will segment the cow model for better printing, refine the electrode design, and consider alternative
      manufacturing techniques to improve durability.</p>
